# Adopt a Pet

This project is on React Router, where React Router Dom is used to add client-side routing to a React Application.
Specifically, this project is about a pet adoption website that allows users to view all the adoptable pets 
of a particular species and view the profiles of specific adoptable pets.

# Tasks being achieved in this project will be to add client-side routing to the application using React Router so that:

* The HomePage component responds to the browser’s current URL by displaying only pets of the species the user wishes to view.

* The PetDetailsPage page displays when the browser’s current URL includes a specific pet’s id.

* The PetDetailsPage displays data for the correct pet based on the id in the URL parameters’ values.

* When the user searches for a pet in the search bar, they are redirected to the SearchPage, 
  which uses the query parameter called name to filter pets by name.
  
* When a user clicks a pet whose details are not available, they are redirected to a PetNotFoundPage.
 From the PetNotFound page, users can click “Go Back” button that will take them to page they were previously on.
